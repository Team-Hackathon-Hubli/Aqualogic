## Problem Statement
Natural disasters like floods, gas leaks, and land vibrations are unpredictable and often deadly. Traditional detection methods are manual or delayed. There is an urgent need for timely, automated alerting systems that reduce impact and improve emergency response.

---

## Solution Overview
AquaLogic is an IoT-powered early warning and monitoring system combining multi-sensor hardware, cloud connectivity, and real-time notifications. The system continuously tracks environmental parameters and issues instant alerts through SMS and email when hazardous thresholds are exceeded.

---

## Key Features
- Real-time flood level detection
- Gas leakage monitoring
- Seismic vibration sensing
- Automatic SMS alerts via Twilio
- Email notifications via Gmail SMTP
- Local buzzer alarm for immediate awareness
- Manual reset button
- Optional dashboard deployed via Cloudflare

## How to Run / Test the Project

1. **Flash ESP32:**
   - Open `code/main.ino` in Arduino IDE.
   - Fill in:
     - WiFi SSID and password.
     - Twilio credentials (SID, Auth Token, Twilio number).
     - Gmail SMTP credentials (email, App Password).
   - Upload the sketch to the ESP32.

2. **Twilio Setup:**
   - Create an account at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com).
   - Generate your Account SID and Auth Token.
   - Verify recipient phone numbers if on a free plan.

3. **Gmail SMTP Setup:**
   - Enable 2-Step Verification in Gmail.
   - Generate an App Password [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   - Use this password in your Arduino code instead of your regular password.

4. **Cloudflare Deployment (Optional):**
   - Configure a dashboard to visualize sensor data.

5. **Test the System:**
   - Simulate high water levels, gas presence, or vibrations.
   - Confirm SMS, email, and buzzer alerts are triggered.
